<h4> 12 user stories:<h4/>

As a user, I want to be able to create 'tags' to classify songs that I enjoy and share my thoughts with others. <br/>
As a user, I want to search for songs using specific tags, so that I can find new music beyond traditional genres.<br/>
As a user, I want to be reccomened users that have had similar activity to me so that I can connect with people who have similar musical tastes.<br/>
As a user, I want to see songs that other users have added to tags, so that I can listen to music that others think match the tag.<br/>

<h4> 12 exceptions: <h4/>
  
A search for song by tag returns nothing.
  - There will be a clear message that explains that the tag has no songs yet added to it and reccomends that the user adds a song
  
A user's tag creation fails.
  - There will be a clear message with the error, (ie. Your tag exceeds the character limit. Please stay within 50 characters)

No user reccomendations have been made.
  - A message will be shown stating that to get reccomendations, the user needs to interact more by adding more songs to tags, creating tags, or just searching for music.

Reccomendations don't seem like the users have similar tastes.
  - The data that was used to make that reccomendation will be stated, (ie. You were reccomended this user because of your interest in the #Summer2025 tag)
