Welcome to SonicLink! A backend API built for the purpose of musical social interaction.

---

## 📌 Overview

The goal of SonicLink is to use existing muisc based datasets such as [Spotify Music Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solomonameh/spotify-music-dataset) to generate a community of individuals who are able to add unique `tags` and  `likes` to songs they enjoy building a new level of musical interaction.

### 🏷️ What are tags?
 Tags are meant to be community generated quips that users can attach to a specific song. They are meant to classify songs in a fun a playful manner to express interest or connections. 

 Tags enable interaction by allowing others who agree with a specific tag on a song to upvote the tag.

### 🌎 Discovery

Users can query songs that have specific tags attached to them allowing them to find music that better connects to their taste beyond just genere or artist.


### 👥Social Interaction
Now that users can add tags and likes to a song how can they interact with others? 

Tag Leaderboards enable users to view their top upvoted tags as well as tags that others placed that are big hits!
