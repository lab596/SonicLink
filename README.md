# SonicLink

Welcome to SonicLink! A backend API built for the purpose of musical social interaction.

---

## üìå Overview

The goal of SonicLink is to use existing music based datasets such as [Spotify Music Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solomonameh/spotify-music-dataset) to create meaningful connections based on interactions with songs. By making unique `tags` and  `likes`, users can be matched to others by the songs they enjoy. Building a whole new level of musical interaction!

### üè∑Ô∏è What are tags?
 Tags are meant to be community generated quips that users can attach to a specific song. They are meant to classify songs in a fun a playful manner to express interest or connections. 

 Tags enable interaction by allowing others who agree with a specific tag on a song to upvote the tag.

 ### üéµ Wait what about lyric moments?
 Users can also express themselves through lyrical moments which are quips associated to specific lyrics in a song - allowing for more modular expression.


### üë•Social Interaction
Now that users can add tags and likes to a song how can they interact with others? 

Tag Leaderboards enable users to view their top upvoted tags as well as tags that others placed that are big hits!

Users can follow other users getting a constant feed of `tags` from their friends. Users can also participate in challenges made by friends to farm aura among friends.
