# SonicLink

Welcome to SonicLink! A backend API built for the purpose of musical social interaction.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of SonicLink is to use existing muisc based datasets such as [Spotify Music Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solomonameh/spotify-music-dataset) to create meaningful connections based on interactions with songs. By making unique `tags` and  `likes`, users can be matched to others by the songs they enjoy. Building a whole new level of musical interaction!

### 🏷️ What are tags?
 Tags are meant to be community generated quips that users can attach to a specific song. They are meant to classify songs in a fun a playful manner to express interest or connections. 

 Tags enable interaction by allowing others who agree with a specific tag on a song to upvote the tag.

### 🌎 Discovery

Users can query songs that have specific tags attached to them allowing them to find music that better connects to their taste beyond just genere or artist.


### 👥Social Interaction
Users will be reccomended a set of users that enjoy similar music and have the same listening preferences.
