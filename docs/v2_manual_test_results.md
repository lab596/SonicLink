## Flow 3: Linking with Other Users ðŸ‘¯

Tony Stark has been listening to a lot of music, but he's feeling a little lonely with all of the Avengers mad at him. He wants to be recommeneded other Sonic Link users who enjoy similar music.

1. Tony calls `POST /tags` with:
   - user_id: 4
   - song_id: "001pyq8FLNSL1C8orNLI0b"
   - tag_text: "Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist"

2. His friend Pepper Potts calls `POST /tags` with:
   - user_id: 5
   - song_id: "0017XiMkqbTfF2AUOzlhj6"
   - tag_text: "Smart, Rich, Playa, Humanitarian"

3. Pepper Potts also calls `POST /tags/upvote` on the tag that Tony made because she enjoys the song.

4. Tony then calls `GET /recommended` and is returned Pepper Potts' user_id, because she upvoted his tag and made her own tag with similar wording.

5. Tony can now call  `GET /users/:user_id/tags` with Pepper's user_id and see the music she's been enjoying and hopefully find new music.
