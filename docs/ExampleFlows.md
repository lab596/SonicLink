## Flow 1: Tag Creation and Upvote Interaction ðŸ”¥

Rohan discovers a new Japenese bop track that reminds him of Tokyo Drift. He decides to tag the song.

2. Rohan calls `POST /tags` with:
   - user_id: 1
   - song_id: "spotify:track:abc123"
   - tag_text: "drifting into the lead"

3. His friend Lebron sees the tag and resonates with it. He calls `POST /tags/456/upvote` with his user_id.

4. Rohan checks how well his tags are doing by calling `GET /users/1/tags`.
